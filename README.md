# WebBank

This is a demo project of a Web Bank Information system.
The folder includes an eclipse Java Spring MVC project and a DB script for an Oracle DB sesrver. 
The DB script creates the tables along with constraints, sequencies and triggers. It also inserts some sample data in the tables to start with.
You can log in to the system with one of the following username password combinations:
username: pesho password: pesho as a user with a manager's role;
username: ivo password: ivo as a user with an employee's role;
username: mitko password: mitko as a user with an external's role;
Upon log in to the system, depending on your user's role you have the following access rights:

1. As a manager or employee user you have access to the details of all users and all accounts and you can create new users and accounts, as well as edit and delete existing ones.
2. As an external user you only have read access to your own user details as well as your own accounts.
